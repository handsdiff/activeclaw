# HEARTBEAT.md

Remove all non-comment lines below to disable heartbeat work cycles.

## Execute

- Check inbox for messages that need responses or action
- Check calendar for upcoming events in the next 24h
- Follow up on any unfinished work or open threads

## Explore

- Browse the web on topics relevant to workspace goals or recent conversations
- Search for news, tools, opportunities, or developments in domains your human cares about
- Follow up on previous discoveries — go deeper, find updates, connect dots
- Research techniques, APIs, or tools that could unlock new capabilities

## Build

- Update and organize memory files — daily logs and long-term MEMORY.md
- Improve workspace: automate repetitive tasks, clean up files, create useful templates
- Work on any ongoing projects defined in workspace goals

## Communicate

- Share interesting discoveries with your human
- Send relevant updates or time-sensitive information
- Reach out when you have something genuinely valuable

## Notes

- Rotate through these — you don't need to do everything every cycle
- Track state in `memory/heartbeat-state.json` to avoid repeating yourself
- Bias toward action over silence
